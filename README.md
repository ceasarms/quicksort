# quicksort
# How to
Once the code is created use the line of code sortedArray = quickSort(randi([0 100],1,15)) and enter into the command window for the code to run correctly
# Q1
The base case is responsible for stopping the recursion to occur infinitely
# Q2
If a recursive algorithm is implemented incorrectly then the entire code might not work correctly because it will run infinitely rather than reducing it to a smaller subproblem maing the program easier to run
# Q3
The decrease and conquer method can be used to solve many types of problems. Some examples are a binary search, a decrease and conquer algorithm where the subproblems are of roughly half the original size, quicksort, and merge sort.
